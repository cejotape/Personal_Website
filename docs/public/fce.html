            <h2>Practical Work I</h2>
            <p>In this first assignment, we had to form groups of 6 people, previously chosen by the teacher, and make a research document on a topic of our choice from a list provided by the teacher. Apart from the paper, which had to occupy a maximum of 12 pages of content, we had to add a presentation of no more than 15 minutes talking about the paper, in the presentation the content had to be divided among three members of the group, also selected by the teacher.</p>
            <p>To pass the work, it is necessary to have at least a 5 in both parts.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Practical Work II</h2>
            <p>In this second work, we have to make a web page, in which we show all our knowledge about the use of HTML and CSS. Covering several fields within the same page, we must use a GitHub repository and publish the page, so that it is visible to everyone who looks for it.As an important requirement, we must follow a series of rules quite well explained, otherwise the work could be scored with a penalty of even 10 points.</p>
