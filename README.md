# Personal_Website

This is my personal website created to document and showcase everything I have learned in this subject.

## Description
- This is my webpage for the Practical Work II, and I am explaining and detailing the process of it.

- There is a main folder called Personal_Website, all the folders and files of the work are located in this folder.
- The first you see when you enter to the folder are the a folder called docs and the README file, the license and the .gitignore.
- Once you enter in docs you may see three folders, called CSS, images and public respectively, and a html file called index.html, where all the basic structure of the web is located.
- CSS styles are developed in an external file (`styles.css`) common to all HTML pages and stored in the CSS folder. 
- The GitHub repository is used to manage the version control for the project. 
- All images used in the website are stored in the images folder.
- And in the public folder we have all the html files, we can go to one to other whenever we want as they are linked all, except the fce.html file that is only linked with the degree.html file, here I leave a brief description of each file.
- **index.html**: Main section that shows information about the website. 
- **about.html**: Information about me, including a brief bio, curriculum vitae, images, and social media links. 
- **contact.html**: An easy form to contact me. 
- **net.html**: Information about partner pages with links. 
- **topic.html**: An explanation about a chosen topic. 
- **degree.html**: A detailed overview of my degree, including a dedicated page for the "Fundamentals of Computer Engineering".

## Actions
- Adding index.html, the basic structure of the web.
- Created the about.html file.
- Created the contact.html file.
- Created the net.html file.
- Created the topic.html file.
- Added the styles.css file to the web.
- Created the degree.html file.
- Created the fce.html file and inserted the link in the degree.html part.
- Done the last changes of the index.html, the about.html and added content in the css file for the respective photos.
- Solved some problems with the content of the images folder.
- Aiming to solve a problem with the net.html and the contact.html file, the syles does not aply on them.
- Solved the problem.
- Done more changes to all html files, and also the css file.
- Finally done the last git add and the last git push with all the changes done.

## Difficulties faced during the development of the work
- I had to repeat several times the repository due to not giving attention to the git add and git commit actions, so I just didn't do it at first, finally I ended up being able to put all in order and to have all organizated as it is requested.
- I had some problems at the moment of making public the web, when the link was generated there were some parts of the web that didn't charge correctly or the images didn't appear, I solved everything.
- I didn't see the rubric at first time, so I have to readjust the Curriculum Vitae.
- Same problem with the fce.html file, I didn't see that the parts of the practical works were needed, already solved.
- Links and images in topic.html added the last due to the same.

## Conclusions
- As an important conclusion, I would say that the importance of putting the correct paths is remarkable, I have seen a lot of errors just because of an incorrect path.
- In terms of style, once you have the basis of the styles file you can "forget" that part, because there is no necessary to do more changes once you like the style.
- While doing the code is very important not to forget closing everything, I mean this <a></a>, because if not it changes the whole content and you may not notice where the problem is.
- It is also significant to put a lot of attention in the whole work, because you mix code with links and with normal redaction so it is very easy to have any mistake.
- Personally, I think that this work has helped me to see more in what I am, to understand better how my degree is while looking for the subjects and creating the tables, also I have realized that what I am doing in this degree is what I really like, that is learning about something I like.
- Finally, this is my Practical Work II and I hope it doesn't disapoint you, thanks for reading.
